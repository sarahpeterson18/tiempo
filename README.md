Design Philosophy
Minimal. Chic. Detached.
Tiempo uses a refined grayscale palette with subtle accents. The interface is clean and spacious, focusing on content over decoration. No unnecessary animations, no bright colors demanding attention—just calm, functional design.

Why PDA-Friendly?
Traditional productivity apps create pressure with:

❌ Reminders and notifications
❌ Streaks and completion percentages
❌ "You should" language
❌ Forced daily habits

Tiempo respects your autonomy:

✅ Pull-based (you check in when YOU want)
✅ Tasks linked to "why" (not obligations)
✅ Energy-level awareness (no guilt for low capacity)
✅ No tracking required (use what helps, ignore the rest)
